- 👋 Hi, I’m @sfc-gh-colingoyette
- 👀 I’m interested in: supporting Snowflake clients' use of platform services to develop AI-driven applications; and, supporting the internal implementation & release of AI/ML governance & monitoring solutions (read: the evolution of TruEra's software) within the Snowflake ecosystem.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: LLM app development, including RAGs; wrapping my head around the Snowflake ecosystem(!)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on technical GTM development for Snowflake's AI/ML ecosystem, e.g., building custom demos of new Snowflake products and/or their integration with popular ML tools. 
- 📫 How to reach me: colin.goyette@snowflake.com

- ⚡ Fun fact: ..two truths, and a lie: (1) I'm ambidextrous; (2) I've never been to the arctic circle; (3) I own a 10ft python.
